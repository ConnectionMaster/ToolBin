All the great tools we have for the field.
We provide binary files for seachest and openseachest

## SeaChest vs openSeaChest

Which tool do you need? SeaChest or openSeaChest?

The good news is these tools are nearly identical to the closed source version.
The difference is the closed source version includes some capabilities not available in openSeaChest, such as Seagate Clean.

SeaChest can also be found on the [Seagate website](https://www.seagate.com/support/software/seachest/).

openSeaChest is the open source version of Seagate's SeaChest tools, available [here](https://github.com/Seagate/openSeaChest). These tools are updated and more options and capabilities are being added all the time.

If you cannot find a binary for your operating system in this repository, you may need to build them. Build instructions are available, but if you run into trouble, please open an issue on that repository.
